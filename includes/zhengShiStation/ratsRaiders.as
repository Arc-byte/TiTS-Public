// repeat Encounters
// Random Approach Text 1
The next step you take, something inherently aggravating comes into view. Three black-clad figures are squatting down the corridor, thin tails weaving around hunched feet; they're happily chatting the time away. Whilst this might be an ordinary sight anywhere else, you know those rodents are affiliated with one of the gangs here on Zheng Shi. Before you can bail, they spot you and spring to their feet, charging in your direction. In only a few seconds they're snickering at you, invading your personal space, and prodding for your things all over again. Geez, these runts can move fast...
// RAT 2
	From behind you hear a flurry of footfalls. Armored feet stomp against the ground and you spin around with your [pc.weapon] at the ready. You spot three rat thieves sauntering slowly up to you, having shifted gears in that split second of reaction. They lazily handle their stun batons while their long tails slash the air behind them. Just like before, they're keeping close as they intrude upon your personal space, preventing easy escape. Where the hell do they come from?
// RAT 3
Just before you reach another split, an electrically charged rod is swung out in front of you. You stop on your heels, nearly colliding with it before jumping back, your whole body tensing up as a snickering laughter reverberates off the walls. The hand holding the shock-stick, wearing a shining blue wristband, swells into the diminutive body of a rodent stepping out with two others. {ratRepLowMedHigh: Not this shit againâ¦ /goodCEO: Here you go againâ¦}
// RAT 4
The next step you take brings you into the sight of another group of mouse thieves, huddled together, furtive and vulnerableâ¦ Rats in a maze. Your approach startles them from their quiet nap. Shaking the sleepiness off, they hurriedly cut off your means of easy retreat before giving you the usual rundown. Crap.
// RAT 5 (Silly, but 10% chance to play outside of Silly)
"Rats, we're rats... weee'rrreee <i><b>the rats</i></b>!" A smooth bunch of singing voices break out abruptly. You turn to see <i>just</i> where it's coming from... "We prey at night, we stalk at night, we're <i><b>the rats</i></b>!" They slither closer to you, punctuating their strange song and dance by smacking their electrical batons against the wall. "We're the giant rats that make aaalll of the rules!" The rodenian girl smirks at you. Before you know it, they've encircled you. "Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into!"
You sigh loudly and slap a sticky hand away from your waist. God damn it.
// RAT 6 (Silly)
	A throbbing growl takes you off guard. This sound isâ¦ it's not a sound you'd expect to hear on a station. Certainly not where you're standing! All of a sudden, three motorbikes go racing towards you, indistinguishable helmeted figures astride them. You dive out of the way in shock as they go flying by, theirâ¦ <i>rat</i> tails!? Whipping in the colors trailing off their bikes. Smoke fills the area as the sound dissipates, making you cough. By the time it clears, three different figures are standing in the clearing, each one a mouse-morph figure dressed in black armor.
They walk up to you like nothing had just happened, pointing their batons at you. The fuck..?
// RAT 7 (Silly)
	Something odd up ahead catches your eye. A dapper man in a black suit wearing a strangeâ¦ <i>creepy</i> mask pirouettes towards you, his dance perfect and rhythm elegant. He stops in front of you with a flourish, and you notice a giant mouse on his shoulder and a fancy cane in his left hand. "Into your sanctum you let them in. This wretched mischief is now coursing through your soul," he says, tapping you coldly on the shoulder. What? He then points his cane behind you, and when you turn, three mouse-eared pirates lamely walk forward, smiling confidently.
"Them filthy rodents are still coming for your soul, never to let go. They're still coming after you, and there's nothing y'can do," the man's mechanical voice comes again, ending with an AAWOAAAAH not unlike background chorus in a song. You whip around, the hairs on your neck standing, to find that he's gone. Was he ever there? What the hell was that all about? 
Shit, now you have to deal with rats again!
